The assignment was to create a game where a spy navigates through a 9x9 grid with evenly spaced rooms. One of the rooms
contains a briefcase that the spy is attempting to find. Additionally, there are 6 randomly moving ninjas that can mortally stab the spy!
The spy can respawn up to two times at the bottom left corner of the grid.  Lastly, there are randomly generated powerups
scattered throughout the 9x9 grid to help defeat the ninjas.

Team Blank consists of Aaron Lim, Koshi Huynh, Jonathan Camarillo, Justen Minamitani, Saroj Poudel, and Steven Marrero.

Our solution to recreate this game was to create a 9x9 2D array that contains a "Square" class. The "Square" class
contains the majority of the information including whether or not it contains the character, a ninja, a powerup, a room,
or a briefcase. There were multiple other classes such as a "Character" or "Ninja" to help create the final game.
This approach was successful and resulted in a complete final game.

In conclusion, as this was our first team project, there were multiple adversities faced along the way. First of all,
our group quickly realized that thorough and detailed communication is key. We found that multiple people would commit to working
on the same section of the project.  This would result in clashing ideas and code, thus 
slowing down the game development process.

Another lesson learned was to create a very specific plan and execute that plan.
Our group did not create a very detailed plan when we began coding. This eventually resulted in a very scattered and independent
working process. However, our group was still able to complete the final game with all of its basic features. Lastly, although 
our group completed the game, there are more advanced options that we would have liked to implement. These features included having
multiple floors (not just a square grid), different weapons, and different characters that have different attributes such as speed or health.

The development process was interesting, and the experience was valuable.  We hope you enjoy the game!
